# Rock, Paper, Scissors Project

## Project Objective
In this project, I made a "first to five" rock paper scissors webpage.
This was my first foray into Javascript, and I practiced using query
selectors and event listeners.

### Future Improvements
* Make the page mobile-friendly
* Add more CSS to make the page look a little more polished
